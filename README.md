# Django-Contact-list

I have done this project to learn how the Django works behind the scenes. I learned how the Django interacts with front-end and how it can be useful to implement different concepts of reusability in the front-end part. Also learned how Django routes the different pages with checking their authenticity to view the correct page with the help of urls and views file.
